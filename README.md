This project was inspired by the course ["Learn Flutter & Dart to Build iOS & Android Apps"](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) by Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The course was instrumental in providing a solid foundation in Flutter app development.
